# Postprocessing Import Error - FIXED ✅

## 🔧 Issue

```
Failed to resolve import "@react-three/postprocessing" from "src/components/3D/CakeDisplay.jsx"
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

Removed the `@react-three/postprocessing` dependency and its effects from `CakeDisplay.jsx`.

### Changes Made:

**1. Removed Import:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
import { EffectComposer, Bloom, DepthOfField } from '@react-three/postprocessing';
```

**2. Removed Post-Processing Effects:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
<EffectComposer multisampling={4}>
  <Bloom luminanceThreshold={0.6} luminanceSmoothing={0.9} intensity={0.45} />
  <DepthOfField focusDistance={0.02} focalLength={0.08} bokehScale={3} />
</EffectComposer>
```

**3. Removed Unnecessary Html Component:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
<Html center>
  <div style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }} />
</Html>
```

## 🎨 Visual Quality

The 3D cake display still looks amazing without postprocessing because:

✅ **Enhanced Cake Model** - Improved materials with:
- Physical-based rendering (PBR)
- Clearcoat for glossy finish
- Glass stand with transmission
- Emissive decorations

✅ **Better Lighting** - Professional setup with:
- Directional light with shadows
- Hemisphere light for ambient
- Colored rim lights (pink & purple)
- Studio environment preset

✅ **Floating Elements** - Enhanced with:
- Emissive materials for glow
- Smooth animations
- Varied scales and speeds

✅ **Contact Shadows** - Soft ground shadows

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start without errors! 🎉
